**Credit Card Usage Trends Across Different Demographics**

📌 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes credit card usage trends across various demographics, including age, income level, occupation, and geographical location. By leveraging data analytics techniques such as descriptive statistics, trend analysis, and correlation analysis, we identify spending patterns, repayment behavior, and credit utilization rates.

🎯 **Objectives**

Understand how spending habits differ across age groups and income levels.

Identify the most common spending categories among different demographics.

Analyze credit utilization behavior across different geographic locations.

Provide insights for financial institutions, policymakers, and businesses to develop better strategies.

💡 **Problem Statement**

"Analyzing Credit Card Usage Trends Across Different Demographics to Understand Spending Behavior and Financial Patterns."

📊 **Data Analytics Approach**

🔹 Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: Checked and addressed null values.

Removing Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate records.

Data Formatting: Ensured consistent data types.

🔹 Data Analysis Techniques

Grouping & Aggregation (groupby()): Summarizing data for different demographic groups.

Pivot Tables: Extracting insights on spending behavior based on different factors.

Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between spending and demographics.

🔹 Data Visualization

Bar Charts & Scatter Plots: Comparing spending across age groups and genders.

Pie Charts: Visualizing distribution of spending categories.

Heatmaps: Showing intensity of spending across different demographics.

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy: Statistical analysis and calculations.

Matplotlib: Basic data visualization.

Seaborn: Advanced statistical visualization.

📌 Key Insights & Findings

1️⃣ Spending Patterns by Age Group

Young Adults (18-30): High spending on entertainment, online shopping, and travel.

Middle-Aged (31-50): Increased spending on necessities, loans, and family-related expenses.

Older Adults (51+): More focused on healthcare and utilities.

2️⃣ Credit Utilization by Income Level

High-Income Earners: Utilize premium credit cards for rewards and travel.

Middle-Income Groups: Balance between discretionary spending and essential expenses.

Low-Income Groups: Higher reliance on credit for daily necessities, leading to higher debt.

3️⃣ Category-Wise Spending Trends

Groceries, Utilities, Healthcare: Universal across demographics.

Luxury Goods & Travel: More common among higher-income individuals.

Education Loans & EMIs: Higher spending in the younger age group.

🔍 Conclusion & Business Impact

Banks & Financial Institutions: Can design personalized credit card offers, adjust credit limits, and improve risk models.

Businesses & Marketers: Can target specific consumer segments more effectively.

Policymakers: Can implement financial literacy programs to encourage responsible credit usage.
